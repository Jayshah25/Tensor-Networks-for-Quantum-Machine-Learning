# Tensor Networks for Quantum Machine Learning 

This project is undertaken as a part of QOSF cohort 8 by Jay Shah (Mentee), Anton Simen (Mentor) and Alejandro Gomez (Mentor). 

Objective: Investigate the use of Tensor Networks for Quantum Neural Networks using Pytorch and Pennylane.

Significance of the problem:

1. Tensor Networks reduce a high dimensional tensor into product of low dimensional tensors enabling efficiency and improved feature extraction.

2. Thus, Tensor Networks can improve the performance of QML architectures despite the limited qubits availability.

As a part of the project, we solve Binary Classfication and Multiclass Classification using MNIST and IRIS datasets respectively.

Results: MPS Tensor Network based QML Architectures successfully solved Binary Classification (100% accuracy) and Multiclass Classification (92% accuracy) tasks.

Future Work: Investigate the suggested architecture on complex tasks (NLP tasks) and architecture (Transformer).
